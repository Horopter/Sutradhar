## Upload Issues

Upload 500 on >2GB via web: suggest Desktop app or split file; escalate if Business.

If upload fails after 3 retries, check file format compatibility.

For Business customers experiencing upload issues, escalate to tier-2 support.

## Export Problems

Export timeout errors: reduce video length or resolution.

Watermark appears on Free plan exports - this is expected behavior.

1080p export failures: check available storage space.

## Authentication

SSO login failures: verify SAML configuration in admin panel.

Password reset emails delayed: check spam folder, resend if needed.

Session timeout: default is 24 hours, configurable for Business plans.
